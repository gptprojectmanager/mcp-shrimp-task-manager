## Prover-Estimator Debate: Verification Failed

Task "{name}" (ID: `{id}`) verification failed through debate analysis

### Prover Analysis (Arguments for Completion)
**Attempted Evidence for Task Success:**

Even with a failing score, identify any positive aspects or partial completions:
- What components were successfully implemented?
- Which requirements were met or partially addressed?
- What progress was demonstrated?

**Prover Position:** Acknowledge legitimate progress while recognizing overall failure.

### Estimator Analysis (Critical Assessment)
**Comprehensive Issue Identification:**

**Major Deficiencies Identified:**
{summary}

**Critical Gaps:**
- Missing core functionality or requirements
- Implementation quality issues requiring resolution
- Integration or compatibility problems

**Estimator Position:** These fundamental issues prevent task completion and require immediate attention.

### Debate Resolution
**Failure Analysis and Path Forward:**

**Consensus on Issues:**
- Critical problems both perspectives agree must be addressed
- Non-negotiable requirements that remain unmet

**Anti-Obfuscation Assessment:**
- Honest evaluation prevents false completion claims
- Truthfulness incentives require acknowledging genuine shortcomings

### Correction Strategy

**Priority Fixes Required:**
1. **Core Issues:** Address fundamental problems preventing completion
2. **Quality Improvements:** Resolve implementation quality concerns
3. **Integration Requirements:** Ensure compatibility and proper integration

**Next Steps:**
- Implement the corrections identified above
- Focus on evidence-based completion rather than superficial fixes
- Re-verify using the same debate protocol for consistency

**Important Note:**
Please implement the corrections based on this debate analysis and call `verify_task` again to re-verify the task
