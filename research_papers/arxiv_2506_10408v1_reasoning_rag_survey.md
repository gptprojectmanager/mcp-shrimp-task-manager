## Abstract
Survey paper on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches and reasoning techniques for industry challenges.

## Key Points
- Comprehensive survey of RAG methodologies
- System 1 vs System 2 reasoning approaches
- Agentic retrieval patterns
- Industry application challenges

## Notes
- This is a survey paper, not a specific framework implementation
- Does not contain the "DoTA-RAG Framework" referenced in our implementation
- Need to locate the specific framework paper that describes dynamic routing optimization

## Status
‚ùå **Framework Mismatch**: This survey paper does not contain the specific DoTA-RAG methodology we referenced
üîç **Action Required**: Locate the correct paper describing DoTA-RAG dynamic routing framework

## Retrieved Content
Full survey paper focusing on reasoning RAG approaches but lacking the specific framework details needed for our cognitive routing implementation.
