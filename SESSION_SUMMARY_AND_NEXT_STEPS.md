### 🔄 Remaining Tasks
8. ⏳ **Complex System Integration Task** (`42a38bc8-a33d-419f-87b8-4716ca612ed5`) - IN PROGRESS
9. ⏳ **Enterprise-Wide System Architecture** (`17057496-0146-42e5-a99a-48dec94071f8`) - PENDING

### 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED
Despite task completion, **CORE ALGORITHM FLAW** identified:
- **Lines 46-54 in cognitiveRouter.ts**: Still uses hardcoded character counting
- **Academic Non-Compliance**: Character counting ≠ cognitive complexity assessment
- **Research Foundation Missing**: No RACE/FACT framework implementation

## 🚨 Priority Actions Required (Next Session)

### IMMEDIATE (Week 1) - Fix Core Algorithm
1. **Extract RACE Implementation** from DeepResearch Bench repository
2. **Replace Character Counting** (lines 46-54) with multi-dimensional assessment  
3. **Implement Dynamic Criteria** generation for task-specific evaluation
4. **Validate with Benchmarks** using PhD-level tasks

### SHORT-TERM (Week 2) - Enhance with Cognitive Tools  
1. **Extract Methodology** from arxiv:2506.12115 (Cognitive Tools paper)
2. **Implement Sequential Processing** patterns
3. **Add Reasoning Elicitation** techniques  
4. **Performance Testing** against 62.5% improvement benchmark

### MEDIUM-TERM (Week 3-4) - DoTA-RAG Integration
1. **Access Full Paper** for DoTA-RAG methodology
2. **Implement Dynamic Routing** with thought aggregation
3. **Replace Static Thresholds** with adaptive patterns
4. **Academic Compliance Validation**

- **Phase 3A**: ⏳ PENDING (DoTA-RAG MCP server) 
- **Phase 3B**: ⏳ PENDING (AlphaEvolve MCP server)

## 🚀 Resumption Instructions

When resuming the session:

1. **Immediate Priority**: Address hardcoded character counting in cognitiveRouter.ts (lines 46-54)
2. **Research First**: Extract RACE framework implementation from DeepResearch Bench repository  
3. **Academic Foundation**: Use papers in `/research_papers/` directory for guidance
4. **Validation Required**: Test against PhD-level benchmarks before proceeding
5. **Git Documentation**: Commit all changes with detailed messages for future reference

## 🔗 Key Dependencies

- **MCP Servers**: Graphiti (localhost:8010) and Supabase (localhost:8000) 
- **Academic Papers**: All recovered and saved in research_papers/
- **Repository Access**: DeepResearch Bench for RACE implementation details
- **Performance Metrics**: Current system functional but academically non-compliant

---

**CRITICAL**: The core cognitive routing algorithm must be corrected before proceeding with Phase 1D or additional phases. Current implementation violates academic research foundations despite functional architecture.

**STATUS**: 🔴 **URGENT CORRECTION REQUIRED** - Academic compliance gap identified and documented with clear implementation roadmap.
