# Phase 1A: Cognitive Tools Framework Implementation

## Overview

Phase 1A enhances Shrimp Task Manager's planning capabilities by integrating cognitive scaffolding patterns into task decomposition and structured planning. This implementation leverages prompt-based enhancements rather than direct code modifications.

## Implementation Strategy

### Prompt-Based Enhancement Approach

The cognitive tools framework is implemented through strategic prompt modifications that trigger cognitive scaffolding during task planning phases. This approach provides:

- **Mathematical reasoning enhancement** through structured problem decomposition
- **Logical scaffolding patterns** for complex task analysis  
- **Systematic problem-solving frameworks** during planning
- **Cognitive load reduction** through guided thinking processes

### Key Components Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced PlanTask Tool Integration
- **Target**: `/src/tools/task/planTask.ts` (via prompt enhancement)
- **Method**: Cognitive scaffolding triggers in planning templates
- **Benefit**: Automatic activation of structured thinking for complex problems

#### 2. Cognitive Scaffolding Templates
- **Target**: `/src/prompts/templates_en/planTask/hasThought.md`
- **Enhancement**: Cognitive framework triggers and reasoning patterns
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing thought processing chain

#### 3. Mathematical Reasoning Framework
- **Approach**: Structured decomposition patterns in prompts
- **Activation**: Triggered by complexity assessment (TaskComplexityLevel)
- **Scope**: Enhanced reasoning for mathematical and logical tasks

## Technical Architecture

### Cognitive Scaffolding Activation

```typescript
// Conceptual integration with existing complexity assessment
interface CognitiveScaffoldingTrigger {
  complexityLevel: TaskComplexityLevel;
  taskType: 'mathematical' | 'logical' | 'analytical' | 'creative';
  scaffoldingPattern: 'decomposition' | 'systematic' | 'comparative' | 'synthesis';
  reasoning_enhancement: boolean;
}
```

### Prompt Enhancement Strategy

1. **Detection Phase**: Identify tasks requiring cognitive enhancement
2. **Activation Phase**: Trigger appropriate scaffolding patterns
3. **Guidance Phase**: Provide structured thinking frameworks
4. **Integration Phase**: Seamlessly integrate with existing workflows
