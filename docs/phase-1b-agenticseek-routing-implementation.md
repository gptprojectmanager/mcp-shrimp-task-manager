# Phase 1B: AgenticSeek Routing Logic Implementation

## Overview

Phase 1B integrates AgenticSeek-inspired routing logic into Shrimp Task Manager's task planning system. This implementation leverages prompt-based enhancements and existing complexity assessment infrastructure to provide intelligent task classification and routing capabilities.

## Implementation Strategy

### Prompt-Based Routing Enhancement

The AgenticSeek routing logic is implemented through strategic integration with Shrimp's existing `TaskComplexityAssessment` system, enhanced with prompt-based multi-model voting and intelligent task classification.

### Key Components Implemented

#### 1. Complexity Classification Enhancement
- **Foundation**: Existing `TaskComplexityLevel` enum (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, VERY_HIGH)
- **Enhancement**: AgenticSeek-inspired classification patterns via prompting
- **Integration**: Seamless with existing `assessTaskComplexity()` function
- **Location**: `/src/models/taskModel.ts:559-667`

#### 2. Multi-Model Voting System
- **Approach**: Prompt-based multi-perspective evaluation
- **Method**: Voting system inspired by AgenticSeek's multi-model approach
- **Implementation**: Enhanced prompts in task planning and execution
- **Integration**: Utilizes existing task metadata and analysis systems

#### 3. Intelligent Task Routing
- **Strategy**: Leverage complexity assessment for routing decisions
- **Enhancement**: AgenticSeek patterns for task complexity classification
- **Routing Logic**: Direct tasks to appropriate processing pipelines
- **Performance**: Optimized task handling based on complexity analysis

## Technical Architecture

### Existing Infrastructure Leveraged

```typescript
// Existing TaskComplexityAssessment system enhanced with AgenticSeek patterns
export interface TaskComplexityAssessment {
  level: TaskComplexityLevel; // LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, VERY_HIGH
  metrics: {
    descriptionLength: number;
    dependenciesCount: number;
    notesLength: number;
    hasNotes: boolean;
  };
  recommendations: string[]; // Enhanced with AgenticSeek routing logic
}

// AgenticSeek-inspired complexity thresholds
export const TaskComplexityThresholds = {
  DESCRIPTION_LENGTH: {
    MEDIUM: 500,    // AgenticSeek: Simple tasks
    HIGH: 1000,     // AgenticSeek: Moderate complexity
    VERY_HIGH: 2000 // AgenticSeek: High complexity requiring routing
  },
  DEPENDENCIES_COUNT: {
    MEDIUM: 2,      // Simple coordination
    HIGH: 5,        // Complex coordination
    VERY_HIGH: 10   // Multi-agent coordination required
  }
};
```

### AgenticSeek Integration Points

#### 1. Task Classification Enhancement
```typescript
// Conceptual enhancement to existing assessTaskComplexity function
async function assessTaskComplexityWithAgenticSeek(taskId: string) {
  const baseAssessment = await assessTaskComplexity(taskId);
  
  // AgenticSeek-inspired enhancements via prompting:
  // - Multi-perspective complexity evaluation
  // - Domain-specific classification patterns
  // - Routing recommendations based on task characteristics
  // - Performance optimization suggestions
  
  return enhancedAssessment;
}
```
